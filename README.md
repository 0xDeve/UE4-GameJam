# UE4-GameJam
Finnish Game Jam


A small game created for Finnish Game Jam and Global Game Jam. The game uses pure blueprints for faster compilation time due to limited time from the jam.

The theme for the game is Transmission. So the game follows a specify rule: to transmit something or anything related to transmission.

In our game, the rule is fairly simple. Your comrade's ship is located behind the enemy lines (enemy's ships). Your mission is to transfer the message
to our comrade by shooting the signal. The signal should bounces when it hits obstacles such as rocks. 

You only have limited chances so make sure to finish the mission withing turns.
